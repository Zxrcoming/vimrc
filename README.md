+ Using Vim, you can definetely feel free and feel vim is what you're builing and using, that feeling is the the coolest thing when you're coding.

*Here is [my vim config file](https://github.com/Zxrcoming/vimrc/blob/master/vimrc)*

1. As Vim is can be fully custmize, so you can change the default vim-keybinding to your most comfortable and enjoyable keybinding just because vim can.And you can even change how your vim-plug behave,just simply tell it what to do in what time.

 	and here is my keybindings(I get used to the default keybindings though I just tweak a little)

	| fast moving           | Key binding |
	|-----------------------|-------------|
	| move down 5 lines     | J           |
	| move up 5 lines       | K           |
	| move left 5 character | L           |
	| move righ 5 charater  | H           |
	| move forward 5 words  | W           |
	| move backward 5 words | B           |
	----above is the most usable keybindings in daily use.----

	and some other keybindings for some vim-plugs I've installed is written very detailed in [vimrc](https://github.com/Zxrcoming/vimrc/blob/master/vimrc)   
	**If you're interested, hope it can help you!**

	(note: the default vim-keybinding is **h** for left, **j** fordown,and **k** for up,**l** for right, )


2. Then using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage your vim plugs, so you can make Vim a better editor for you!
